Full description
----------------

Touch Snake offers a modern and touch-friendly version of the classic game of snake.
The specificity of Touch snake compared to the original snake comes from a head-centered view.
You have to explore a non-fully-displayed map. Enjoy this fun gaming experience!

Availability
------------

Touch Snake is available for free on [Google Play](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.zimmisapps.touchsnake).

It is not available yet on the Apple App Store because we don't want to pay Apple $99/year for a few more downloads.
If you are an iPhone developper and would like to help, contact us.
Otherwise, you can also buy us an iPhone and give us an additional 100 bucks and we'll oblige.

Touch Snake will soon be available as a web app for anyone to play, though.

License
-------

Normally, we would publish this app under a copyleft license.
But, because we have heard of the existing incompatibilities between app stores and the GNU GPL,
we're not in a hurry to publish this as a free software (it's already a freeware).
If you are interested in contributing, contact us and we'll pick a license so that it's possible
for you to submit your changes.
Meanwhile, the GitHub user policy still allows you to view and fork the code.

Compilation
-----------

We use Ludei's CocoonJS to compile the HTML/Javascript code into native apps for mobile platforms.
